This project is a real-time facial detection model that incorporates sentiment analysis and adaptive music playback to enhance safety and create an engaging atmosphere in kindergarten settings. The system leverages Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to improve detection accuracy, ensuring reliable performance even in dynamic and lively environments. Sentiment analysis of detected faces determines the mood, and in response, suitable music is played to match or uplift the sentiment. For instance, happy music plays when a positive sentiment is detected, while calming tunes are used for neutral or sad emotions. This model is designed to adapt to real-time changes, creating a safer, emotionally attuned, and positive environment for young children.
